                <p>GST CALCULATOR<br><br>
                  You have to develop a POINT-OF-SALES system to which you have to pass the ID of the items to be added in the bill. The products are divided into 4 categories each having different tax-slabs [5%, 12%, 18%, 28%].<br>
                  Add a few products in each category by yourself where each product must have 4 properties:
                  <ul>
                    <li>ID</li>
                    <li>NAME</li>
                    <li>PRICE</li>
                    <li>TAX-RATE</li>
                  </ul>
                  The INPUT should include the number of items and ID of each item.<br>
                  The OUTPUT must display the bill with 5 columns:<br>
                  <b>ID - NAME - PRICE - GST - TOTAL AMOUNT</b><br>
                  At the end of the list, display the total amount to be paid by the customer.<br><br>
                  NOTE: If any ID is passed against which no product exists, such products should be mentioned at the end of the list as UNTRACKED PRODUCTS.
